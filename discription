Underwater Object Detection Using YOLO in Google Colab  

This project implements underwater object detection using the YOLOv8* model in Google Colab. It aims to detect and classify underwater objects like fish, corals, marine debris, plastic waste, and more with high accuracy.  
 Key Features:  
Dataset Preparation: Collected and preprocessed underwater images with labeled objects.  
Model Training: Fine-tuned YOLOv8 using Google Colab's Tesla T4 GPU for real-time detection.  
Evaluation Metrics: Performance analyzed using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP.  
Applications:Useful for marine research, pollution monitoring, and aquatic life conservation.  

This project enhances underwater monitoring by providing efficient and automated object detection for research and environmental tracking.
